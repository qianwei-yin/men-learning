# Backend App Built By MongoDB, Express and Node.js

### About

Imagine you are going to build a Tour website (like Expedia), then many of your functionalities can be built by this powerful backend.
<br>

### Most Proud of

##### Feature-rich API w/ documentation

âœ… Includes endpoints related to tours, users, reviews, authentication and authorization.
âœ… Many customized features which helps business analyzation.
âœ… More than 30 endpoints and usage are listed in a [detailed documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25223323/2s935mrPtb#bd5e3ba3-952b-4117-8797-868456768c04).
<br>

##### SECURE Authentication/Authorization

âœ… Compromised Database

-   Strongly encrypt passwords with salt and hash (using bcrypt)
-   Strongly encrypt password reset tokens (SHA 256)

âœ… Avoid brute force attacks

-   Use bcrypt (to make login requests slow)
-   Implement rate limiting (express-rate-limit)

âœ… Avoid cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

-   Store JWT in HTTPOnly cookies
-   Sanitize user input data
-   Set special HTTP headers (using helmet package)

âœ… Avoid denial-of-service (DOS) attacks

-   Implement rate limiting (express-rate-limit)
-   Limit body payload (in body-parser)
-   Avoid evil regular expressions

âœ… Avoid NoSQL query injection

-   Use mongoose for MongoDB (because of SchemaTypes)
-   Sanitize user input data

âœ… Others

-   Use HTTPS
-   Create random password reset tokens with expiry dates
-   Deny access to JWT after password change
-   Not send error details to clients
-   Prevent parameter pollution causing Uncaught Exceptions
